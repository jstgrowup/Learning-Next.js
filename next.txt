Different CSS in different components
any global CSS will be imported into _app.js 
if the cSS is component level than we will write module.css else we write the global CSS
-----------------------------------------
Styled JSX
this is component level css the scope is component level only
 <style jsx>
          {
            `
  .mySpan{
    color:red
  }
  `
          }
        </style>

if you want your css to be global than 
 <style jsx global>
          {
            `
  .mySpan{
    color:red
  }
  `
          }
        </style>
no setup for server side rendering so its easy to work on NEXT js 
easy concepts of page creation internal routing and for routing we dont have to do any configurations 
we just add files to the pages folder --> file system routing no preloading of unnecessary data while clicking on the link 
Dynamic routing --> [id].js
because the code is not there in the page source thats why it doesnt provides better SEO in the react apps
